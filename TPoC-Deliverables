GitHub.com Pilot Technical POCs,

 

At the beginning of the Pilot it was indicated, that while you were actively in the pilot, you would not need to:

1.  Submit code to Dimensions nor

2.  Submit a VDD/S, but

3.  A code notification to [*CM Tools*](https://webmail.bah.com/owa/redir.aspx?SURL=6wbImWDOwPYE90-ltoTwpZLK4KiLb6TbXN93f5ZG2NsJ4ZWEvQfTCG0AYQBpAGwAdABvADoAdQBzAGMAaQBzAC0AYwBtAHQAbwBvAGwAcwBAAHUAcwBjAGkAcwAuAGQAaABzAC4AZwBvAHYA&URL=mailto%3auscis-cmtools%40uscis.dhs.gov) is still required.

 

We need information from each team on when they are completing their first *deployment to production* using GitHub.com so that the CM Tools and QA teams can be informed about  these relaxed requirements (\#1 & \#2) are in effect.
